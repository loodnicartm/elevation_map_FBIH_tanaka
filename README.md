# elevation_map_FBIH_tanaka
This R script generates a Tanaka-style shaded relief map of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH), using digital elevation data to simulate three-dimensional terrain with a stylized, vintage cartographic effect.

The Tanaka method enhances topographic visualization by combining light and shadow along contour lines, creating a hand-drawn appearance that improves terrain readability while maintaining scientific accuracy.

-Key Features:
Load and preprocess elevation raster data for the FBiH region

Apply Tanaka-style hillshading using the tanaka package

Overlay administrative boundaries for geographic context

Export a clean, publication-ready topographic map

-Technologies & Libraries:
Uses raster, sf, elevatr, ggplot2, and tanaka packages to produce elegant terrain visualizations suitable for both scientific and educational purposes.

-Applications:
Ideal for physical geography visualization, cartographic design, educational material, or terrain analysis in the Western Balkans region.
